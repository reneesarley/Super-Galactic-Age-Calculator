## Planning

1. Configuration/dependencies
  * Dependencies will include: webpack (including: uglifyjs, devserver, command line), eslint for catching syntax errors, babel, karma and jasmine for testing
  * Dependencies are defined in package.json

2. Specs
  * Spec 1: Convert earth years to seconds (assuming there are 365.25 days in a year,24 hours in a day, 60 minutes in an hour, 60 seconds in a minute). Input 35.5 years Output: 1,120,294,800 seconds.
  * Spec 2: Take two dates and determine the difference in seconds between the two, Input: 5/21/80 8/1/18, Output: 1,205,539,200 seconds
  * Spec 3: Convert earth years into Mercury year (.24), Input: 35.5 earth years, Output: 8.52 mars years
  * Spec 4: Convert earth years into Venus years (.62), Input: 35.5 earth years, Output: 22.01 Venus years
  * Spec 5: Convert earth years into Mars years (1.88), Input: 35.5 earth years, Output: 66.74 Mars years
  * Spec 6: Convert earth years into Jupiter years (11.86), Input: 35.5 earth years, Output: 421.03 years
  * Spec 7: Convert earth life expectancy into life expectancy for each planet, Input: 88 earth years, Output: {earth: 88, mercury: 21.12, venus: 54.56, mars: 165.44, jupiter: 1043.68}
  * Spec 8: Calculate how many years a user has left to live on each planet, Input: user's age of 35 earth years, Output: {earth: 53 mercury: , venus: , mars: , jupiter: }
